# Quick Fix Plan Based on Debug Tests

## Root Cause Identified

**Primary Issue**: Pages load but JavaScript doesn't execute properly, causing:
- Empty page titles (`document.title` returns "")
- Missing JavaScript functions (defined in `<script>` tags)
- Non-functional storage operations
- Event handling crashes in `waitForSelector`

## Evidence from Debug Tests

### ✅ Working Components
- Browser creation & basic operations
- Simple JavaScript execution (`2 + 2`)
- Element detection (`elementExists("h1")`)
- URL management & page source retrieval

### ❌ Failing Components
- Page title retrieval (`document.title` = "")
- In-page JavaScript functions (`testStorage` not found)
- Storage operations (localStorage/cookies)
- Event waiting methods (segfault in `waitForSelector`)

## Immediate Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Page Loading Timing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Pages load but JavaScript doesn't execute before tests run
**Solution**: Increase wait times or improve page-ready detection

**Files to modify**:
- Browser tests: Increase sleep times from 1-2 seconds to 3-5 seconds
- Improve `waitForPageReady` to actually wait for JavaScript execution

### Fix 2: EventLoopManager Segfaults (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `waitForSelector` causes segmentation faults
**Solution**: Fix race conditions in event handling

**Files to investigate**:
- `src/Browser/Events.cpp` - `waitForSelector` method
- `src/Browser/EventLoopManager.cpp` - Event loop handling
- Memory management in event callbacks

### Fix 3: JavaScript Execution Context (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Functions defined in HTML `<script>` tags aren't available
**Solution**: Ensure proper JavaScript context loading

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test minimal browser functionality
cd /home/bigattichouse/workspace/headlessweb/debug/build
./debug_minimal

# Test storage operations
./debug_storage

# Test event handling (with timeout to prevent hangs)
timeout 30s ./debug_events
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix page loading timing issues
2. **Critical**: Fix event handling segfaults  
3. **Follow-up**: Address JavaScript execution context issues

This focused approach should resolve 80%+ of the failing tests by addressing the core page loading and event handling issues.
