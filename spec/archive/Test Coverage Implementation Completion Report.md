   - Method signatures and parameter types require verification

2. **Session Class Interface**:
   - Test calls like `getUrl()`, `getFormData()` need alignment with actual Session API
   - Data access patterns require verification

3. **Assertion Manager API**:
   - Test calls like `addAssertion()`, `executeAssertions()` need alignment with actual API
   - Result retrieval methods require verification

4. **FileOps Manager Methods**:
   - Upload/Download manager method calls need verification
