- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive failure scenario testing

### **Test Environment Requirements**
- **Test Server**: Utilize existing Node.js server with file endpoints
- **File Fixtures**: Test files of various types and sizes
- **Mock Network Conditions**: Simulate slow/failed transfers
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Test on Linux (primary), Windows/macOS compatibility

## üîÑ Phase 2B Preparation: Advanced Waiting Systems

### **Preview of Next Implementation Phase**
Following Phase 2A completion, Phase 2B will implement:

#### **Advanced Wait Mechanisms**
- [ ] **Text Appearance Waiting**: Monitor for specific text content
- [ ] **Network Idle Detection**: Wait for network activity completion  
- [ ] **JavaScript Condition Polling**: Custom condition-based waiting
- [ ] **Element Count Monitoring**: Wait for specific element quantities
- [ ] **Dynamic Content Stabilization**: Wait for content to stop changing

**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks after Phase 2A completion

## üìà Success Metrics

### **Phase 2A Completion Criteria**
1. **‚úÖ Functional Completeness**: All file operations work reliably
2. **‚úÖ Test Coverage**: 95%+ unit test coverage, comprehensive integration tests
3. **‚úÖ Performance Standards**: Upload/download operations complete within acceptable timeframes
4. **‚úÖ Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Verified functionality on primary platforms
5. **‚úÖ Documentation**: Updated spec documents and user guides

### **Quality Gates**
